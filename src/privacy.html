							<p><strong>9.1. Fees.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> You can access certain portions of the Services by submitting a fee payment (such additional services, “Paid Services”).

To ensure uninterrupted service, we'll automatically bill you for certain Paid Services from the date you submit your initial payment and on each renewal period thereafter until cancellation.

For example, if you're on a monthly subscription plan, each billable renewal period will be for one month. We’ll automatically charge you the applicable amount using the payment method you have on file with us. We’ll let you know in advance if you’re purchasing a Paid Service that includes auto-renewal payments. You can disable auto-renewal at any time </strong>

								<a href="mailto:legal@squarespace.com"><span style="font-size:12px">legal@squarespace.com</span></a><span style="font-size:12px"> with a description of your claim. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by following up via email, phone or other methods. If we can’t resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of our receipt of your first email, you or Squarespace may then bring a formal proceeding.</span></p>
							<p><strong>16.2. Arbitration Agreement. You and Squarespace agree to resolve any claims arising from or relating to the Services or this Agreement through final and binding arbitration and you and Squarespace expressly waive trial by jury, except as set forth below. Discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights that you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> </span><strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</strong></p>
							<p><strong>16.3. Arbitration Opt-Out. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at </strong>
								<a href="mailto:arbitration-opt-out@squarespace.com"><strong>arbitration-opt-out@squarespace.com</strong></a><strong> within thirty (30) days of the date that you first agree to this Agreement (“Opt-Out Period”). Your email must be sent from the email address you use for your Account, and must include your full name, residential address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out of arbitration pursuant to this Section 16.3, then Sections 16.2, 16.4, 16.5 and 16.6 of these Terms do not apply to you. This opt-out doesn’t affect any other sections of the Terms, including without limitation Sections 16.8 (Judicial Forum For Disputes; Time For Filing), 16.9 (No Class Actions) and 17.2 (Controlling Law). If you have any questions about this process, please contact </strong>
								<a href="mailto:legal@squarespace.com"><strong>legal@squarespace.com</strong></a><strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
							<p><strong>16.4. Arbitration Time For Filing. </strong><span style="font-size:12px">Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law prohibits a one year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
							<p><strong>16.5. Arbitration Procedures.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”) will administer the arbitration in accordance with the </span>
								<a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"><span style="font-size:12px">JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures</span></a><span style="font-size:12px"> (“JAMS Rules”) in effect at the time of the dispute. You and Squarespace agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, so the US Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply and govern the interpretation and enforcement of these provisions (despite the choice of law provision below). Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York, in English, and shall be settled by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and costs), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </span></p>
							<p><strong>16.6. Arbitration Fees.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> The JAMS Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. We won’t seek our attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</span></p>
							<p><strong>16.7. Exceptions To Arbitration Agreement.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> Either you or Squarespace may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York, New York or any United States county where you live or work. Either you or Squarespace may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process described above. </span></p>
							<p><strong>16.8. Judicial Forum For Disputes; Time For Filing. </strong><span style="font-size:12px">If our agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, or if you opt out of arbitration pursuant to Section 16.3, you and Squarespace agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) must be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of New York, New York and you and Squarespace consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in those courts. Any claim not subject to arbitration must be commenced within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law prohibits a one year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
							<p><strong>16.9. NO CLASS ACTIONS.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> </span><strong>You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated or representative action. Class actions, class arbitrations, private attorney general actions and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed. </strong></p>
							<p><strong>17.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><strong>Additional Terms</strong></p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<blockquote><span style="font-size:12px">This Agreement is the whole agreement between us regarding your use of Squarespace. If we ever change it in a way that meaningfully reduces your rights, we’ll give you notice and an opportunity to cancel. Also, if you’re reading this in a language other than English, note that the English language version controls.</span></blockquote>
							<p><strong>17.1.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> </span><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Squarespace regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes and replaces any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no third party beneficiary rights.</span></p>
							<p><strong>17.2. Controlling Law.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> This Agreement and the Services shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</span></p>
							<p><strong>17.3. Waiver, Severability And Assignment.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement is not a waiver of our right to do so later. If any provision of this Agreement is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under this Agreement, and any such attempt will be void. We may assign our rights under this Agreement to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</span></p>
							<p><strong>17.4. Modifications. We may modify this Agreement from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our site. If a modification meaningfully reduces your rights, we’ll notify you (by, for example, sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice within the Services). The notice will designate a reasonable period after which the new terms will take effect. Modifications will never apply retroactively. By continuing to use or access the Services after any modifications come into effect, you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using the Services.</strong></p>
							<p><strong>17.5. Translation.</strong><span style="font-size:12px"> This Agreement was originally written in English (US). We may translate this Agreement into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version and the English version, the English version will control.</span></p>

							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">While no service is completely secure, we have a security team dedicated to keeping your information safe.

							<p><strong>2.9. Cookies And Other Technologies.</strong><span style="font-size:13.3333px"> We use these technologies to do things such as remember your preferences, keep you safe and improve and promote the Services. You can read more about how we use these technologies in our </span>

							<p><strong>3.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">When you use the Services, we may share your information only as described below:</span></p>
							<p><strong>3.1. Third Parties You Authorize. </strong><span style="font-size:13.3333px">You can give third parties access to your and your End Users’ information on the Services. For example, you may wish to integrate Your Sites with a third party newsletter service that requires access to the email addresses you collect from your End Users, in order for that newsletter service to send emails on your behalf and at your direction. Just remember that such third party’s use of this information will be governed by the terms and privacy policies of the third party.</span><br><br><strong>3.2.</strong><span style="font-size:13.3333px"> </span><strong>Following The Law. </strong><span style="font-size:13.3333px">We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, protect our rights or prevent fraud or abuse of Squarespace or our users. When we receive law enforcement or national security requests for information, we strongly believe in privacy and transparency. We scrutinize such requests carefully and challenge vague, overbroad or otherwise unlawful requests. And when legally permitted, we provide our users with notice that their information is being requested. This notice is provided so that you have the opportunity to challenge such requests. </span></p>
							<p><strong>3.3. Others Working For Squarespace. </strong><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Squarespace uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, promote and protect the Services. For example, we may use third parties to help us provide customer support, manage our ads on other sites or assist with data storage. These third parties may access, process or store your information to perform tasks only for the purposes we’ve authorized, and we require them to provide at least the same level of protection for your information as described in this Privacy Policy. We also may share with third parties aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.</span></p>

							<p><strong>4.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><strong>Protection</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">While no service is completely secure, we have a security team dedicated to keeping your information safe. We employ security measures such as using firewalls to protect against intruders, building redundancies throughout our network (so that if one server goes down, another can cover for it) and testing for and protecting against network vulnerabilities. Payment information is transmitted using HTTPS encryption, and we maintain a PCI DSS certification. </span></p>
							<p><strong>5.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><strong>Retention</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">We'll retain your personal information for as long as we need it to provide you with the Services. You can ask for your personal information to be deleted at any time by deleting your Account or contacting us at </span>

							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Information that you submit through the Services may be transferred to countries other than where you live (for example, to our servers in the US). We also may store information locally on the devices you use to access the Services. We also may transfer information to third parties outside the US for processing or to support the Services, and we require them to provide at least the same level of protection for your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
							<p><strong>7.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><strong>Access</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">To modify or delete the personal information you have provided to us, simply log into the Services and update your profile. We may retain certain information as required by law or for necessary business purposes. On request, we'll provide you with a copy of your personal information that we maintain. This request may be subject to a fee not exceeding the prescribed fee permitted by law.</span></p>
							<p><strong>8.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><strong>Communications</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">We may periodically email you service-related announcements. We'll also send you emails related to your transactions.

							<p><strong>10.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><strong>Privacy Shield</strong></p>
							<p><strong>10.1.

We’ve certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles and, assuming our certification is approved, you’ll be able to find it </span>

							<p><strong>10.2. Accountability. </strong><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Our accountability for EU Personal Data we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles.

							<p><strong>10.3. Inquiries And Disputes. </strong><span style="font-size:13.3333px">If you have questions you believe to be within the scope of our Privacy Shield certification, please contact us first at </span>
								<a href="mailto:privacy@squarespace.com"><span style="font-size:13.3333px">privacy@squarespace.com</span></a><span style="font-size:13.3333px"> and we'll respond within 45 days.

							<p><em>Last updated: September 26, 2016</em></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Welcome to our Squarespace + Getty Images (US), Inc. (“Getty”) image terms of service (“Image Terms”).</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">These Image Terms, along with our </span>
								<a href="https://www.squarespace.com/terms-of-service/"><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Terms of Service</span></a><span style="font-size:13.3333px">&nbsp;and </span>
								<a href="https://www.squarespace.com/acceptable-use-policy"><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Acceptable Use Policy</span></a><span style="font-size:13.3333px">, cover your licensing of any Getty images via the Services (“Licensed Images”). Any capitalized terms not defined in these Image Terms have the meanings set forth in our </span>
								<a href="https://www.squarespace.com/terms-of-service/"><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Terms of Service</span></a><span style="font-size:13.3333px">.&nbsp;</span><br><br><strong>Where and how can I use Licensed Images?</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">You are allowed to use Licensed Images on the site for which you license them (that is, a single Squarespace URL and the collection of domains pointing to it). However, purchasing a Licensed Image under these Image Terms does not convey any ownership rights in the underlying Licensed Images, and your usage rights are limited to only what is described here. If you would like to purchase additional licensing rights for Licensed Images (like offline or advertising use), you can purchase such rights directly from Getty via a link provided in the Services.</span></p>
							<p><strong>Where and how can I use watermarked (i.e., not licensed) images?</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Watermarked images are provided for private use only, so you can get a feel for how an image would look on one of your pages. You cannot otherwise use any watermarked images. Notably, that means you cannot display them on public sites, or otherwise share them with others.</span></p>
							<p><strong>For how long can I use Licensed Images?</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">You can use Licensed Images for the lifecycle of the site for which you license them. So, if you maintain your site for 10 years, you can use the Licensed Images on your site for 10 years.</span></p>
							<p><strong>Can I use the same Licensed Image more than once on the same site?</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Yes. You can use the same Licensed Image multiple times on the same site.</span></p>
							<p><strong>Can I use the same Licensed Image on different sites?</strong></p>
							<p>No. Licensed Images are site-specific, so you would need to purchase a new license for each site on which you want to use it. For example, if you wanted to use the Licensed Image on three different Squarespace sites, you would need to purchase three licenses (one license through each site).</p>
							<p><strong>What is your refund policy for Licensed Images?</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">We do not provide any refunds on any purchases of Licensed Images.</span></p>
							<p><strong>If I leave Squarespace and export my contents, can I take Licensed Images with me?</strong></p>
							<p>Yes. Even if you stop using the Services, you can take Licensed Images with you and you’re free to use them on another site hosted elsewhere, provided that you’re only using the Licensed Images on a single site.</p>
							<p><strong>Anything else?</strong></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Yes, just two more things.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">First, if you use Licensed Images in an editorial context (such as opinion pieces about newsworthy or public interest events), you must include a credit line such as:</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">[Photographers Name]/[Collection Name]/[Getty Images or iStock].</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">Second, you can’t use Licensed Images: (a) on a standalone basis with no other content; (b) in electronic templates for the creation of separate electronic or printed products; (c) in physical or digital retail products, such as e-cards, calendars, posters or screensavers, or otherwise provide them for sale or file-sharing; or (d) in logos, trademarks, service marks or other branding.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size:13.3333px">We hope you enjoy your Licensed Images!</span></p>
